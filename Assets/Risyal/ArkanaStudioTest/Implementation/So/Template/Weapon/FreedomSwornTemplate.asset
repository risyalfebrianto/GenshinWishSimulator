    When the character
    wielding this weapon triggers Elemental Reactions, they gain a Sigil of Rebellion.
    This effect can be triggered once every 0.5s and can be triggered even if said
    character is not on the field.

    When you possess 2 Sigils of Rebellion,
    all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain "Millennial
    Movement: Song of Resistance" for 12s.

    "Millennial Movement: Song of Resistance"
    increases Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG by 16% and increases ATK by
    20%. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Rebellion for
    20s.

    Of the many effects of the "Millennial Movement," buffs of the same
    type will not stack.'
